dataset source: https://zenodo.org/record/5070945#.ZAjfY-zMJzU

Outcome: Developed prediction models for 1) infant method of falling asleep 2) high or low negative emotionality dimension 3) normal or abnormal(?) sleep length at night

Significance: Improve healthcare decision-making by providing a predictive model for infant sleep quality based on maternal mental health difficulties

Future work: Improving the accuracy of the predictive models by incorporating additional relevant features in larger and more diverse datasets
